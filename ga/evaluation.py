"""Fitness evaluation functions for GA objectives."""

# TODO: Implement objective functions
# - Difficulty objective (subset mean of cached entropy scores)
# - Diversity objective (cosine distance in embedding space)
# - Balance objective (class distribution deviation from uniform)
# - Fitness evaluation function returning (difficulty, diversity, balance) tuple
